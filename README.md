<h1>330 Library Management System Terminal Version</h1>
<p>330 Library Management System is a software application and platform designed to automate and streamline various tasks and processes involved in managing a library's resources. Its primary purpose is to efficiently organize, catalog, circulate, and track library materials while providing easy access to library users.</p>
<p>The terminal version of this program was written as a foundation for the GUI version of this application which can be accessed <a href = ">https://github.com/JMyoi/330LibraryManagementSystem_GUI_Version">HERE</a></p>
<p>Both versions of this project were written in the IntelliJ IDEA</p>
<p>The terminal version of this program is a menu-type interface where the user selects the number to its respective options.</p>

<h3>Adversity; Learning JavaFX First: A Lesson in Efficiency</h3>
<p>
While the terminal version of the application provided a solid foundation, devoting time to its
completion may have been an inefficient use of time. The transition from terminal to GUI
unexpectedly proved to be a complex, confusing, and challenging endeavor, requiring
extensive rework and adaptation. In retrospect, it would have been more time-effective to
prioritize JavaFX learning alongside the application's development.
